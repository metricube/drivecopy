=========

Google Apps Script to copy folders in Google Drive.

Motive:
There is a limitation in Google Drive where you can't transfer ownership between
a Google Account and a Google Apps Accounts.   This script was created to facilitate
copying of a directory tree.

Installation:
The script can be installed by going to http://script.google.com and copying the script.gs file or a live version can
be accessed from:  https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwb6cXjEb08CcfIjQ59rTlrW6Klz6rUO7xSvMxDbfbnJhNj9Opd/exec

Usage:
1)  Make sure the source folder is shared so that the target Google Drive account has access to the files
2)  In the target Google drive account - click on the folder to be copied
3)  Take note of folder id - it is part of the URL:

Example:
URL:   https://drive.google.com/#folders/0Bx-GtYAcYz3nRVhyX0RoV1jsT2s
folder id:  0Bx-GtYAcYz3nRVhyX0RoV1jsT2s

4)  Open the script link 
5)  Copy the folder id into the script text box and click copy
